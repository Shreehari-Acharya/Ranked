# Project - Ranked
We're building a platform that brings the excitement of 1v1 competitive programming to Data Structures and Algorithms, similar to what platforms like Matiks or Chess.com have done in their respective domains.

## Core concept
Users will engage in 1 vs 1 DSA battles. Each match will consist of a problem or a set of problems tailored to the players' current rating levels. The outcome of the match affects their ELO-based rating system:

**Win:** Rating increases

**Loss:** Rating decreases

This ensures players are always matched with opponents of similar skill levels, making competitions fair, engaging, and growth-oriented.

## Progressive Difficulty
To ensure continuous learning and challenge, the difficulty of problems evolves with the player's rating:

- Low Rating: Basics like arrays, strings, patterns

- Mid Rating: Recursion, searching, sorting, sliding window, etc.

- High Rating: Advanced topics like trees, graphs, dynamic programming

This system gamifies the learning process, giving users clear goals and visible progress.

## Learning Resources
We’ll include a curated resources section featuring:

Handpicked blog posts

Trusted YouTube videos

DSA sheets and roadmaps

This helps users strengthen weak areas identified during matches, turning losses into learning opportunities.

## Leaderboard and Rankings
Like Chess.com, we’ll have a global leaderboard to fuel competitiveness and motivation. Users can track their improvement and see how they stack up against others worldwide.

## Why This Is Different
Most platforms focus on solving problems in isolation or participating in weekly contests. We're introducing real-time head-to-head battles, adaptive matchmaking, and a dynamic difficulty system that evolves with your skills. The format is both competitive and educational, turning DSA prep into a sport.
